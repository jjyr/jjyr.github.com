This is JJY's blog, sharing some fun tech ideas and boring details.

Recently I focus on blockchain-related techniques and hope techs can make the world more equality.

Programing languages:

* Rust
* C
* Ruby

Some fun projects that I have built:

* [sparse-merkle-tree](https://github.com/jjyr/sparse-merkle-tree) - An optimized compacted [sparse merkle tree](https://justjjy.com/An-optimized-compact-sparse-merkle-tree) implement in Rust.
* [buddy-alloc](https://github.com/jjyr/buddy-alloc) - Buddy allocation algorithm implement in no-std Rust, used for embeded evironments.
* [HDWallet](https://github.com/jjyr/hdwallet) - A BIP-32 related key derivation library implement in Rust.
* [DCKB](https://github.com/jjyr/DCKB) - An [extremely useful token](https://justjjy.com/Break-the-liquidity-limitation-of-NervosDAO) on Nervos CKB.
* [ckb-std](https://github.com/jjyr/ckb-std) - A minimal Rust runtime for the Nervos CKB contract environment.
* [Ciri Ethereum](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri) - An Ethereum implementation written in pure Ruby.
* [LightIO](https://github.com/socketry/lightio) - A user-level green thread library for Ruby.
