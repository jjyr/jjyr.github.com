Just another tech nerd.

Recently I focus on some blockchain-related techniques to make the world more equality.

I also interesting in OS, plan to learn then write my own hobby OS.

Once upon, I write some interesting projects, [Ciri Ethereum](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri) is an Ethereum implementation written in pure Ruby, and [LightIO](https://github.com/socketry/lightio) is a user-level green thread library for Ruby. Now I turn into Rust and C, and you can view my other boring projects on my GitHub.
