I"<p>Just another tech nerd.</p>

<p>Recently I focus on some blockchain-related techniques to make the world more equality.</p>

<p>I also interesting in OS, plan to learn then write my own hobby OS.</p>

<p>Once upon, I write some interesting projects, <a href="https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri">Ciri Ethereum</a> is an Ethereum implementation written in pure Ruby, and <a href="https://github.com/socketry/lightio">LightIO</a> is a user-level green thread library for Ruby. Now I turn into Rust and C, and you can view my other boring projects on my GitHub.</p>
